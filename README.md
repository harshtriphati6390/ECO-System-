# ECO-System-
 üåé ‚Äî EcoData: Environmental Analytics System is a unique Python + SQL Data Analytics project that uses environmental data (like air quality, temperature, and pollution) to generate insights and visualizations.
Clarify goals & KPIs
Decide the project purpose and the key metrics you‚Äôll track (e.g., daily AQI, PM2.5/PM10, temperature, humidity, CO‚ÇÇ, city averages, alerts).
Deliverable: short KPI list and success criteria.

Select data sources
Pick reliable feeds: public APIs (weather/AQI), government open datasets, CSV sensor exports, or manual uploads. Define update frequency (hourly/daily).
Deliverable: data source inventory with access method and refresh cadence.

Design the data model (schema)
Specify the tables/records you need (e.g., measurements with city, timestamp, temp, humidity, aqi, pm25, source; cities metadata). Include timezone & units.
Deliverable: simple schema diagram or spreadsheet describing each field.

Ingest & store data
Choose storage (local SQLite for prototype; Postgres or cloud DB for production). Plan ingestion style: batch imports for CSV/APIs or streaming for real-time sensors. Ensure timestamps are in UTC.
Deliverable: ingestion plan + chosen storage option.

Clean & transform (ETL) rules
Define transformations: parse dates, unify units, fill/mask missing values, remove obvious outliers, and resample to daily aggregates. Keep raw data as-is for auditing.
Deliverable: ETL checklist (order of transforms and validation rules).

Feature engineering & enrichment
Create useful derived fields: daily averages, 7-day rolling mean, AQI category (Good/Moderate/Unhealthy), day-of-week/season flags, and lag features for forecasting.
Deliverable: list of derived features and their definitions.

Exploratory analysis & insights
Run EDA to uncover trends, correlations (e.g., AQI vs. temperature), seasonal patterns, and hotspots. Identify top insights you want the dashboard to highlight.
Deliverable: 5‚Äì10 insight statements (e.g., ‚ÄúCity A‚Äôs AQI spikes on weekdays‚Äù).

Modeling & alerts (optional advanced)
Decide on predictive goals: next-day AQI forecast, anomaly detection for sensor failures, or emission trend projections. Choose simple models (time-series or rule-based alerts).
Deliverable: modeling use-cases and alert thresholds (e.g., AQI > 150 ‚Üí alert).

Dashboard & user experience
Define screens: overview KPIs, city filter, time-series charts, map view, and automated alerts/notifications. Pick tools (Streamlit/Power BI/Tableau) and wireframe the UI.
Deliverable: dashboard wireframes and list of visual components.

Operationalize, monitor & iterate
Put in monitoring (data quality checks, failed ingest alerts), document data retention/privacy rules, and plan iterative improvements (more cities, live APIs, ML retraining). Ensure clear owner/responsibility.
Deliverable: ops checklist (monitoring, backup, access control, and roadmap items).
